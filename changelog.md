\*\*Advanced Prompt Manager:\*\* Introduced a dedicated management dialog in settings to customize default system prompts and manage user-defined prompts with full support for adding, editing, reordering, and previewing.

\*\*Comprehensive Proxy Support:\*\* Resolved network connectivity issues by ensuring that user-configured proxy settings are strictly applied to all API requests, including translation, OCR, and speech generation.

\*\*Automated Data Migration:\*\* Integrated a smart migration system to automatically upgrade legacy prompt configurations to a robust v2 JSON format upon the first run without data loss.

\*\*Updated Compatibility (2025.1):\*\* Set the minimum required NVDA version to 2025.1 due to library dependencies in advanced features like the Document Reader to ensure stable performance.

\*\*Optimized Settings Interface:\*\* Streamlined the settings interface by reorganizing prompt management into a separate dialog, providing a cleaner and more accessible user experience.

\*\*Prompt Variables Guide:\*\* Added a built-in guide within the prompt dialogs to help users easily identify and use dynamic variables such as \[selection], \[clipboard], and \[screen\_obj].
