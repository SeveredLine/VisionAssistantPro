    addon_changelog=_("""## Changes for 4.5
**Advanced Prompt Manager:** Introduced a dedicated management dialog in settings to customize default system prompts and manage user-defined prompts with full support for adding, editing, reordering, and previewing.
**Comprehensive Proxy Support:** Resolved network connectivity issues by ensuring that user-configured proxy settings are strictly applied to all API requests, including translation, OCR, and speech generation.
**Automated Data Migration:** Integrated a smart migration system to automatically upgrade legacy prompt configurations to a robust v2 JSON format upon the first run without data loss.
**Updated Compatibility (2025.1):** Set the minimum required NVDA version to 2025.1 due to library dependencies in advanced features like the Document Reader to ensure stable performance.
**Optimized Settings Interface:** Streamlined the settings interface by reorganizing prompt management into a separate dialog, providing a cleaner and more accessible user experience.
**Prompt Variables Guide:** Added a built-in guide within the prompt dialogs to help users easily identify and use dynamic variables such as [selection], [clipboard], and [screen_obj]."""),
